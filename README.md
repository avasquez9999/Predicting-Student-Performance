#Applying Machine Learning Models to Predict Student Performance
**Understanding the Problem**
We aim to predict student performance based on historical scores, hours of sleep, hours of study, and extracurricular activities. This is a regression problem, as we're predicting a continuous numerical value (performance score).

**Data Preparation**
Data Collection: Gather historical data on students, including their scores, sleep hours, study hours, and extracurricular activities.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Feature Engineering: Create relevant features if necessary, such as combining related features or creating interaction terms.

Data Splitting: Divide the data into training and testing sets.


**Model Selection and Training**

**Multiple Linear Regression:**
**Assumption:** Linear relationship between features and target variable, No multi colinearity between independent variable, Homoscedasticity, Independence of errors,  and normality.
**Implementation:** Use libraries like Scikit-learn or Statsmodels to fit the model.

**XGBoost Regression:** 
**Assumption:** No specific assumption about data distribution.
**Implementation:** Use the XGBoost library to train the model.
**Cross-Validation:**
Technique: Split the data into multiple folds, train the model on a subset, and evaluate on the remaining fold.
Implementation: Use scikit-learn's cross_val_score function.

**Neural Networks:**
**Assumption:** Complex relationships between features and the target variable.
**Implementation:** Use libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch to create and train a neural network.

**Model Evaluation**
Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):: The square root of MSE, providing an error measure in the same units as the dependent variable. Â  

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.

R-squared: Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.
